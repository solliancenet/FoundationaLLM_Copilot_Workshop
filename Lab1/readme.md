### Task 1: Management Portal Discovery
Visit the Management portal site and log in with the credentials that you were provided. Once logged in, explore the portal and familiarize yourself with the different sections and features.

### Task 3: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Click on the `Access Control` button and view the current association of permissions for different `Users` and `groups`. Also notice the button for `Add role assignment for this resource` where you can assign roles to users or groups with granular permissions.
`Try it out`

### Task 4: Share permissions and access
Find a another attendee and share access to your agent with them. You can do this by clicking on the `Access Control` button and adding the user to the list of users with permissions.
Try different permission like `Reader`, `Contributor` and `Owner` and see how the access changes for the other user. Experiment between the 2 of you to get a sense of the granular permissions that can be assigned.
